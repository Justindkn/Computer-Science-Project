			<h2 class="Hardware_Title"> What is "Hardware?"</h2>
			<p>Hardware is defined as "tools, machinery, and other durable equipment." In a computer, this means parts such as the motherboard, CPU, GPU, etc. Each one of these parts has a specific task to perform. Let's talk about a few of them.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="Motherboard">	
			<h2 class="Mobo_Title">The Motherboard</h2>
			<p>The motherboard ("mobo" for short) is the part of a computer that hold all of the other parts and allows communications between them. An empty mobo consists of slots and power connectors. The slots are there to hold other parts of the computer. The power connectors distribute power to the different parts. </p>

		<div class="CPU">
			<h2 class="CPU_Title">The Central Processing Unit</h2>
			<p>The Central Processing Unit (CPU) is the part of the computer that carries out the tasks assigned to the computer by programs. Basically, the CPU is the brain of your computer. It recieves instructions and then carries them out.</p>

		<div class="RAM">
			<h2 class="RAM_Title">Random-access Memory</h2>
			<p>Random-access Memory(RAM) is a type of storage device for computers. As its name suggests it stores data in a random fashion. This makes it faster than other types of storage. However, it becomes less effective the more memory is taken up. RAM also deletes all data stored once your computer is turned off. As a result, RAM never runs out of memory.

		<div class="Hard_Drive">
			<h2 class="HD_Title">The Hard Disk Drive</h2>
			<p>The Hard Disk Drive("HDD" or "Hard Drive") is another type of storage device for computers. It uses spinning disks to store data and a moving arm to read data off of the disks. Unlike RAM which digitally stores data, a hard drive is requires the use of a physical moving actuator arm in order to read and retrieve data. As a result it is slower than RAM.</p>

		<div class="BUS">
			<h2 class="BUS_Title">The Computer Bus</h2>
			<p>The Bus is the part in a computer that transfers data between different parts of the computer. It is used to reduce the number of wires/cables required to connect the different parts. The name of the bus tells you how much data it can transfer at a time. For example, a 16 wire bus can transfer 16 bits of data.</p>

		<div class="Devices">
			<h2 class="Devices_Title">Connected Devices</h2>
			<p>Connected devices allow the user(you)to interface (work) with the computer. These include your mouse, keyboard, and monitor. Without them there would be no way for you to understand the computer and vice-versa. The monitor is the screen where all the data you need is displayed. The keyboard allows you to input commands into the computer. The mouse allows you to navigate and select data.</p><br><br><br>
